# ScienceCore: pCO2 in coastal waters.

Our goal is to develop tutorials data collection, analysis methods, and visualization techniques used in biogeochemistry, using the following paper as a concrete example:
> Le, C., Y. Gao, W-J. Cai, J. Lehrter, Y. Bai, and Z-P. Jiang. [Estimating summer sea surface pCO2 on a river-dominated continental shelf using a satellite-based semi-mechanistic model.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.02.023) Remote Sensing of Environment, 225, 115-126. 

The article describes the use of locally calibrated satellite products to improve the satellite estimation of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in coastal waters.

## Tasks

To follow the estimation of pCO2 in coastal waters, we will need to find, download, and visualize
- Ocean Carbon Data Systems (OCADS, https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/ocads/).
- ??? Cruises
- U.S. Geological Survey 
- Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ([MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about), [Aqua](https://aqua.nasa.gov), [NASA ocean color products](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov)
- Visible and Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite ([VIIRS](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data/near-real-time/viirs))
