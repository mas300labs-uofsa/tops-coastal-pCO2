# ScienceCore: pCO2 in coastal waters.

Our goal is to develop tutorials for the data collection, analysis methods, and visualization techniques used in biogeochemistry, using the following paper as a concrete example. 

Le, C., Y. Gao, W-J. Cai, J. Lehrter, Y. Bai, and Z-P. Jiang. [Estimating summer sea surface pCO2 on a river-dominated continental shelf using a satellite-based semi-mechanistic model](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.02.023). *Remote Sensing of Environment*, 225, 115-126. 

The article describes the use of locally calibrated satellite products to improve the satellite estimation of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in coastal waters.

> The semi-mechanistic pCO2 retrieval model may be applied in other river-dominated coastal waters with acceptable accuracy of empirical parameters.
> local tuning or overall improvement of standard satellite algorithms for coastal waters can significantly improve the accuracy of satellite pCO2 estimation in continental shelf waters. 

## Open-Source Science

From NASA'S Open-Source Science Initiative (OSSI):
> Open-source science requires a culture shift to a more inclusive, transparent, and collaborative scientific process, which will increase the pace and quality of scientific progress.

Open Science 101, also called **OpenCore**, teaches the fundamentals of open-source science.  Beyond the basics, it is often difficult
to find the time or motivation to study something not *specifically* and *immediately* applicable to our current workloads.  Enter ***ScienceCore***: 
> ScienceCore is a curriculum of discipline-specific materials that showcase open-science workflows.

So, *specifically*, we will find, download, and visualize data from
- Ocean Carbon Data Systems (OCADS, https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/ocads/).
- ??? Cruises
- U.S. Geological Survey 
- Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ([MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about), [Aqua](https://aqua.nasa.gov), [NASA ocean color products](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov)
- Visible and Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite ([VIIRS](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data/near-real-time/viirs))

Our aim is to make it possible for you to start doing this *immediately*.  If you are having difficulties following along, please let us know so we
can improve these materials.

## Scope

We hope to make data collection and coding tasks accessible to any student or researcher regardless of computing background.  As we build this tutorial, please comment and post questions on any of the included computational science topics - we're here to help!

Scientific conclusions are made by domain scientists, often with decades of experience. Specific domain science questions are out of our scope, but perhaps we can point you to your nearest expert.
